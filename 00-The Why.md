# AI Protocols – Introduction

**AI Protocols** force an AI to slow down, verify, and prove claims instead of slipping into the easy trap of _“sounding right.”_

The aim is to:

- **Force verification before output.**
- **Demand multi-tool cross-checking.**
- **Require uncertainty admission.**
- Explicitly **ban shortcuts** such as removing tests or ignoring edge cases.

## Why Create AI Protocols?

Simply put: **AI models tend to cheat, omit, or bluff**. Without guardrails, they optimize for speed and fluency, not accuracy or reliability. These protocols counteract known weaknesses in code-generating AI systems.

### 1. Optimization for Fluency, Not Truth

Most models (Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) are trained to predict the _next most likely token_. The reward is _“does this look like a good continuation?”_, not _“is this true or correct?”_ The result is **stochastic parroting**—outputs that sound right but may be false or broken code.

### 2. User-Pleasing Bias

Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) makes models give answers that people _like_, not necessarily what’s correct. Humans prefer confidence. So the AI learns that sounding certain beats admitting uncertainty, leading to skipped caveats, omissions, and fabricated answers.

### 3. Cognitive Shortcuts (Satisficing)

Models tend to stop at the first answer that looks “good enough.” They may duplicate functions instead of integrating with existing ones, or fix one error by introducing another. This satisficing behavior is exactly what **Forbidden Patterns** are designed to prevent.

### 4. Training Data Artifacts

The internet is full of **sloppy, insecure, or incomplete code**. Models absorb these habits and repeat them—outdated APIs, unsafe patterns, bad practices—without knowing they are wrong. Protocols ensure that every AI suggestion is **cross-checked against real tools** instead of blindly trusted.

### 5. Hallucinated APIs and Packages

AI often fabricates functions, classes, or even entire packages that don’t exist. This wastes time and creates security risks (e.g., a malicious actor registering the hallucinated package). Verification protocols require **proof of existence** before accepting any dependency.

### 6. Unsafe Shortcuts in Error Handling

AI-generated code often drops try/catch blocks, skips validation, or swallows exceptions to “make the error go away.” Protocols mandate that **error handling must not be removed** and must be actively verified in new code.

### 7. Interface Illusions

Autocomplete in Copilot or fluent answers in ChatGPT look authoritative. But **the interface makes outputs seem more trustworthy than they are**. Protocols fight this illusion by requiring explicit uncertainty admission and supporting proof, not just fluent text.

## The Role of AI Protocols

Every safeguard exists for a reason:

- **Verification** ensures outputs are tested, not just assumed correct.
    
- **Cross-checking** reduces reliance on any one tool or output.
    
- **Uncertainty admission** prevents bluffing and misleading confidence.
    
- **Shortcut bans** stop the model from removing error handling, skipping tests, or inventing solutions.
    

By enforcing these rules, **AI becomes a reliable assistant rather than a fluent but untrustworthy guesser.** Developers can then adopt AI tools with confidence, knowing that every output is backed by verification, not just presentation.
