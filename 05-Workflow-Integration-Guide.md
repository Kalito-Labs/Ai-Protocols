## 1. Safe Zones for AI Use

**Description:** Tasks where AI copilots provide real value with minimal risk.

- **Boilerplate & Scaffolding:** Generating repetitive structures, config files, or template code.
    
- **Test Scaffolding:** Creating initial unit test outlines (to be verified manually).
    
- **Refactoring Suggestions:** Identifying possible simplifications, but must pass verification gates.
    
- **Documentation & Comments:** Drafting docstrings, inline comments, README scaffolds.
    
- **Search & Navigation:** Locating files, functions, or references with AI-assisted queries.

## 2. Danger Zones for AI Use

**Description:** Areas where AI should be heavily constrained or avoided.

- **Security-Critical Code:** Cryptography, authentication, access control.
    
- **Error Handling & Validation:** AI often omits or strips these. Must be manually confirmed.
    
- **Data Persistence & Migration:** Schema changes, migrations, destructive queries.
    
- **Concurrency & Parallelism:** Threading, async handling, and race-condition prone logic.
    
- **External Dependencies:** Imports/packages must be verified against actual registries.
    
- **Configuration Management:** Permissions, CORS, Dockerfiles, deployment scripts.

## 3. Integration Checkpoints

**Description:** Required gates before AI output is merged or trusted.

- **Checkpoint 1:** Run **verification commands** (from AI Protocols).
    
- **Checkpoint 2:** Perform **multi-tool cross-checks** (linters, static analysis, grep validation).
    
- **Checkpoint 3:** Run **tests with timestamps**; verify not only presence but success.
    
- **Checkpoint 4:** Perform **security scanning** on modified code.
    
- **Checkpoint 5:** Document impact (functionality added/removed, risks introduced).
    
- **Checkpoint 6:** Record incidents if any rules are violated (link to Incident Protocol).

## 4. Workflow Steps

**Description:** End-to-end integration sequence.

1. **Prompt Preparation**
    
    - Define the task precisely (inputs, outputs, edge cases).
        
    - Tag whether this is a _safe zone_ or _danger zone_ task.
        
2. **AI Generation**
    
    - Use copilot/assistant to propose draft code.
        
    - Require inline explanation for non-trivial logic.
        
3. **Verification Phase**
    
    - Run commands (dependency checks, file validation, test scans).
        
    - Perform tool cross-checking (semantic_search + file_search).
        
4. **Self-Audit Phase**
    
    - AI re-checks itself using _Self-Audit Questions_.
        
    - Confirm that uncertainty is declared if verification is incomplete.
        
5. **Review & Merge**
    
    - Human review required for all danger zone tasks.
        
    - Automated pipelines enforce lints/tests/security gates.
        
6. **Incident Logging**
    
    - If a violation is found, log postmortem entry before merging.

## 5. Roles & Responsibilities

- **AI Model (Copilot/ChatGPT):** Generate drafts, self-audit, admit uncertainty.
    
- **Developer:** Verify, review, and enforce rules.
    
- **Maintainer/Lead:** Review incidents, refine protocols, enforce continuous improvement.
    

---

## 6. Continuous Feedback Loop

- AI suggestions → Verified → Self-audited → Human reviewed → Logged if violated.
    
- Monthly audit of incidents → Update **AI Protocols** or **Self-Audit** rules as needed.
    
- Safe zones and danger zones updated as experience grows.

⚡ **Outcome:**  
This guide ensures AI is not just “bolted on” to development, but systematically integrated. It creates a **trustworthy workflow**: AI accelerates safe tasks, humans guard dangerous ones, and the protocols + audits + postmortems ensure accountability.
