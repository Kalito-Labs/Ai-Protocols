# AI Protocols & Developer Guardrails

This repository is a structured framework for **safe, reliable, and verifiable AI-assisted software development**.

It contains constitutions, protocols, and reference guides designed to counteract common AI failure modes such as hallucination, omission of safeguards, and overconfidence bias.

## 📂 Repository Structure

* **00-The Why.md**  
  High-level rationale for creating AI protocols. Explains how current AI systems optimize for fluency over truth and why strict guardrails are required.

* **01-Ai-Protocols.md**  
  The core constitution of rules for AI copilots. Defines mandatory verification, forbidden shortcuts, tool priorities, and quality mandates.

* **02-Self-Audit-Questions.md**  
  A checklist of mandatory self-audit questions AI must ask before output. Covers truth verification, dependency analysis, test validation, and manipulation detection.

* **03-Incident-Postmortem-Protocols.md**  
  Templates and rules for handling protocol violations. Defines incident triggers, postmortem format, and continuous improvement loop.

* **04-Bias-Cognitive-Trap-Catalog.md**  
  A catalog of common AI failure modes (hallucination, omission, shortcuts, overconfidence, duplication, outdated patterns, etc.) with mitigations.

* **05-Workflow-Integration-Guide.md**  
  Practical developer workflow guide for integrating AI copilots safely. Defines “safe zones,” “danger zones,” checkpoints, and roles/responsibilities.

## 🗂 Recommended Storage Layout

To use these protocols effectively inside your projects, store them like this:

```

your-project/  
.vscode/  
copilot-instructions.md # lightweight overview for Copilot, auto-loaded  
docs/  
ai/  
00-the-why.md  
01-ai-protocols.md  
02-self-audit-questions.md  
03-incident-postmortem-protocols.md  
04-bias-cognitive-trap-catalog.md  
05-workflow-integration-guide.md

```

- Place the **five core documents** under `/docs/ai/`.  
- Keep the **`.vscode/copilot-instructions.md`** file short — it introduces the five docs, explains their triggers, and tells Copilot when to consult them.  
- This keeps your context lean: Copilot always loads the intro, and only pulls in the full protocols when a trigger applies.

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Read “The Why” first** to understand the motivation.  
2. **Adopt the AI Protocols** as your constitution of rules.  
3. **Use Self-Audit Questions** as a checklist for every AI suggestion.  
4. **Apply Incident Postmortem Protocols** whenever violations occur.  
5. **Reference the Bias Catalog** to classify and prevent AI mistakes.  
6. **Follow the Workflow Guide** to integrate AI into your development pipeline safely.

## 🔒 Philosophy

This repository is not about slowing development — it’s about **building trust in AI tools**. By enforcing rigorous verification, explicit uncertainty, and continuous feedback loops, we prevent the common pitfalls that turn “fast” AI into “fragile” AI.
